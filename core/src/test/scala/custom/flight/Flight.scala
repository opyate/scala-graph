/**
 * This object defines the edge type `Flight` needed for the flight route
 * map example as a custom edge type.
 * 
 * A `Flight` has several attributes like `departure` and `duration`.
 * To enable duplicate flights between airports, `flightNo` is added
 * to the key attributes.
 * 
 * Note that this is not a real-life design. For instance, calculating
 * the shortest path does not consider waiting times on the airports,
 * it just uses the flight duration.
 * 
 * For usage see Ttest_shortestPathFunctional in TAlgo.scala.
 * There, things are more complex due to the `factory` variable for
 * which you could just write `Graph` in a real app, instead.
