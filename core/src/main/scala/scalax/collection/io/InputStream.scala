/**
 * Root trait for edge streams. Edge stream methods return the components of an edge
 * from which an inner (or outer) edge in the sense of `Graph` may be composed
 * with the help of a given edge factory. An edge is made up of the components nodes
 * and optionally a weight and a label.
 * Classes derived from this trait may be used as an io-interface to load/unload
 * `Graph` data.   
 * 
 * @tparam N type of nodes.
 * @tparam E type of edges.
 * @tparam L type of edge labels or Nothing.
